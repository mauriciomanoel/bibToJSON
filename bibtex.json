		"abstract": "Machine learning is one of the emerging technologies that has grabbed the attention of academicians and industrialists, and is expected to evolve in the near future. Machine learning techniques are anticipated to provide pervasive connections for wireless nodes. In fact, machine learning paves the way for the Internet of Things (IoT)—a network that supports communications among various devices without human interactions. Machine learning techniques are being utilized in several fields such as healthcare, smart grids, vehicular communications, and so on. In this paper, we study different IoT-based machine learning mechanisms that are used in the mentioned fields among others. In addition, the lessons learned are reported and the assessments are explored viewing the basic aim machine learning techniques are expected to play in IoT networks.",

		"title": "PDS: Deduce elder privacy from smart homes",
		"abstract": "With the development of IoT technologies in the past few years, a wide range of smart devices are deployed in a variety of environments aiming to improve the quality of human life in a cost efficient way. Due to the increasingly serious aging problem around the world, smart homes for elder healthcare have become an important IoT-based application, which not only enables elders’ health to be properly monitored and taken care of, but also allows them to live more comfortably and independently in their houses. However, elders’ privacy might be disclosed from smart homes due to non-fully protected network communication. To show that elders’ privacy could be substantially exposed, in this paper we develop a Privacy Deduction Scheme (PDS for short) by eavesdropping sensor traffic from a smart home to identify elders’ movement activities and speculating sensor locations in the smart home based on a series of deductions from the viewpoint of an attacker. The experimental results based on sensor datasets from real smart homes demonstrate the effectiveness of PDS in deducing and disclosing elders’ privacy, which might be maliciously exploited by attackers to endanger elders and their properties.",

		"abstract": "This study aims to explore factors influencing behavioral intention to adopt hearing aids among old adults in smart cities. It argues that trust is a moderator to influence the relationship between attitude, subjective norm and individual's behavioral intention in smart cities. This study tests hypotheses using a sample of 103 respondents from six smart cities in China. The results reveal that attitude is main factor influencing individual's behavioral intention. Subjective norm and trust are both not statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval in the model of multiple-regression. Interestingly, it finds that trust moderates the relationship between subjective norm and individual's behavioral intention. It means that the audiologists' advice can positively affect person's behavioral intention in smart cities. The findings imply that the Theory of Reasoned Action can be partially used to explain the person's behavioral intention in Chinese context. This study contributes to encourage old people to use smart hospitals to consult audiologists about hearing loss and hearing aids rehabilitation. Hence, hearing aids can improve their quality of life (QoL), which can be reflected by the improved standard of living, better access to treatments and also the positive sentiment about their life, including comfort, friendship, happiness and a closer connection to the society.",

		"abstract": "Smart Cities need to be designed to allow the inclusion of all kinds of citizens. For instance, motor disabled people like wheelchair users may have problems to interact with the city. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies provide the tools to include all citizens in the Smart City context. For example, wheelchair users may not be able to reach items placed beyond their arm’s length, limiting their independence in everyday activities like shopping, or visiting libraries. We have developed a system that enables wheelchair users to interact with items placed beyond their arm’s length, with the help of Augmented Reality (AR) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies. Our proposed system is an interactive AR application that runs on different interfaces, allowing the user to digitally interact with the physical items on the shelf, thanks to an updated inventory provided by an RFID system. The resulting experience is close to being able to browse a shelf, clicking on it and obtaining information about the items it contains, allowing wheelchair users to shop independently, and providing autonomy in their everyday activities. Fourteen wheelchair users with different degrees of impairment have participated in the study and development of the system. The evaluation results show promising results towards more independence of wheelchair users, providing an opportunity for equality improvement.",

		"abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) offers a seamless platform to connect people and objects to one another for enriching and making our lives easier. This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as smart wearables, smart home, smart mobility, and smart cities. In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, device–network–human interfaces, security, and privacy.",

However, the decisive outcome of the development relies heavily on the demand side. Consumer choice among advanced Internet broadband technologies will determine the achievement of the development. This study aims to illustrate that consumer decisions on choices of advanced Internet access are influenced by the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. A bivariate probit model is applied to examine the effects of IoT, consumer's individual characteristics, and their current use of networks on their decision pertaining to the choice of advanced Internet access. Using Thailand as a case study, the result indicates that the emergence of IoT applications accelerates the adoption of both advanced mobile broadband (5G) and advanced fixed broadband (FTTH).

		"abstract": "A Smart City is a cyber–physical system improving urban behavior and capabilities by providing ICT-based functionalities. An infrastructure for Smart City has to be geographically and functionally extensible, as it requires both to grow up with the physical environment and to meet the increasing in needs and demands of city users/inhabitants. In this paper, we propose iSapiens, an IoT-based platform for the development of general cyber–physical systems suitable for the design and implementation of smart city services and applications. As distinguishing features, the iSapiens platform implements the edge computing paradigm through both the exploitation of the agent metaphor and a distributed network of computing nodes directly scattered in the urban environment. The platform promotes the dynamic deployment of new computing nodes as well as software agents for addressing geographical and functional extensibility. iSapiens provides a set of abstractions suitable to hide the heterogeneity of the physical sensing/actuator devices embedded in the system, and to support the development of complex applications. The paper also furnishes a set of methodological guidelines exploitable for the design and implementation of smart city applications by properly using iSapiens. As a significant case study, the design and implementation of a real Smart Street in the city of Cosenza (Italy) are shown, which provides decentralized urban intelligence services to citizens.",

		"abstract": "The rapid proliferation of smart city (SC) projects is a response to the challenges posed by rapid urbanization such as energy shortage, economic reconstruction (the drive towards higher productivity and efficiency) and demographic increase. Ubiquitous information communication technologies (ICTs) in SCs enable people to understand and manage cities more efficiently and sustainably, thus improving their life quality. However, a number of potential pitfalls have been noted in the development of SC. This study aims at identifying potential pitfalls in the development of SCs and filling a knowledge gap in this domain. Based on an extensive literature review, four major pitfalls are categorized as system information insecurity, personal privacy leakage, information islands, and digital divide. Possible causes and adverse effects of these pitfalls are discussed with the aid of three international case reviews. In addition, this study looks into existing assessment schemes of SC performance that are mainly focused on the positive and functional capability, but sparingly evaluate the possible downsides. It is argued that a SC cannot claim to be successful by solely measuring how much it has done or what it aims to achieve. While most studies focus on the benefits of SCs, this research reveals the challenges facing city planners. It contributes to the body of knowledge in this regard and also provides an insight into the subject matter. A framework for conducting further research on mitigating potential SC pitfalls has been laid. It is intended to inform practitioners, researchers and policymakers to develop proactive solutions concerning both technological and non-technological aspects at an early stage of SC developments.",

However, the knowledge and framework for data use for smart cities remain relatively unknown. This paper reports findings from an analysis of various use cases of big data in cities worldwide and the authors' four projects with government organizations toward developing smart cities. Specifically, this paper classifies the urban data use cases into four reference models and identifies six challenges in transforming data into information for smart cities. Furthermore, building upon the relevant literature, this paper proposes five considerations for addressing the challenges in implementing the reference models in real-world applications. The reference models, challenges, and considerations collectively form a framework for data use for smart cities.

		"abstract": "A growing number of elderly people (65+ years old) are affected by particular conditions, such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and frailty, which are characterized by a gradual cognitive and physical decline. Early symptoms may spread across years and often they are noticed only at late stages, when the outcomes remain irrevocable and require costly intervention plans. Therefore, the clinical utility of early detecting these conditions is of substantial importance in order to avoid hospitalization and lessen the socio-economic costs of caring, while it may also significantly improve elderly people’s quality of life. This work deals with a critical performance analysis of an Internet of Things aware Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) system for elderly monitoring. The analysis is focused on three main system components: (i) the City-wide data capturing layer, (ii) the Cloud-based centralized data management repository, and (iii) the risk analysis and prediction module. Each module can provide different operating modes, therefore the critical analysis aims at defining which are the best solutions according to context’s needs. The proposed system architecture is used by the H2020 City4Age project to support geriatricians for the early detection of MCI and frailty conditions.",

The objective of this article is to provide an in-depth analysis and validation of real-time scheduling in resource constrained hardware platforms through real-time message passing in presence of a cloud facilitator with a real-time context. A novel dew computing architecture is hereby introduced and proposed to foresee as an enabler of the context-aware service framework in purely real-time fashion. The promising outcomes validated the proposed frameworks when compared to existing alternatives in terms of efficiency, responsiveness and appropriateness.

		"abstract": "To provide a high performance internet of things (IoT) system by integrating cloud computing, data mining, and other intelligent methods to all the people has been a promising trend in recent years. However, the performance of such a system is restricted by several factors, namely, various user requirements, various types of appliances, enormous need of communications, limited network bandwidth, and limited computation power. Considering these restrictions, IoT resource allocation problem (IRAP) is one of the most critical problems because a good solution to this problem will be very useful for enhancing the performance of such a system. That is why an effective algorithm will be presented in this paper for solving the IoT resource allocation problem of the internet of things. The concepts of data clustering and metaheuristic are employed for the proposed algorithm to allocate the large-scale devices and gateways of IoT to reduce the total communication cost between them. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is significantly better than the other resource allocation algorithms compared in this paper in terms of the total data communication costs.",

		"abstract": "This paper argues that the transformation of the contemporary public library can be usefully understood by situating it within the context of the technology-driven urban vision of the ‘smart city’. We explore this through a focus on a recent public library development in Australia where a high-profile new library features as a signature investment in the city's broader digital and ‘smart city’ strategies. In analysing the library's entanglement with the digital visions of this city, our case study reveals the uneven and often contradictory impacts that characterize the digital economy. We argue that the articulation of a technology-led agenda with neoliberal governance settings has produced institutional tensions that go to the core of the library's role in public life, challenging us to consider how libraries might best serve a range of rapidly changing and competing needs and publics. We find that while libraries have been forced to make certain changes, they have also developed proactive responses to new technology. Efforts to reinvent themselves as ‘hubs’, ‘makerspaces’ and co-located community centres offering enriched spaces for social gathering, targeted learning, and new forms of creative production, including entrepreneurial activity and innovation, are strategies for maintaining and extending the traditional remit of the public library. However, these transformations are not adequately recognised within the structures through which libraries are evaluated and funded, thus making them vulnerable to future governmental agendas.",

		"abstract": "Emergence of context-aware technologies and IoT devices reflect that the quality of a human life has become one of the most essential aspects in Smart Cities. With this goal health monitoring of elderly and disabled people have got plenty of attention and focus in the research. The healthcare systems rely on the components responsible for context sensing, processing, storage and inference, and response. In order to make the interoperability among the various healthcare systems, a typical standard is needed in order to uniformly access the context-aware healthcare information coming through a fundamental infrastructure. In this paper, we propose people-centric sensing framework for the healthcare of elderly and disabled people. Such platform is aimed to monitor health of the elderly and disabled person and provide them with a service oriented emergency response in case of abnormal health condition. We focus on three aspects: (a) context manipulation from the mobile device in people-centric environment; (b) emergency response using context base information; and (c) modeling mobile context sources as services. The most distinctive feature of current work is that medical resources are efficiently used to provide them real-time medical services in case of emergency simultaneously extending social network of the elderly people. The system implementation shows that the proposed people-centric sensing system is efficient and cost-effective in health and emergency care.",

		"abstract": "Abstract:
A possible solution to reduce healthcare costs in a world that is aging is the adoption of telehealth technologies. Several solutions appeared, in the past suggesting the use of smart devices (mobile phones or tablets) for supporting telehealth. Unfortunately, elderly people may have difficulties in the use of such devices even if user interfaces are becoming friendly and intuitive. This work introduces the concept of “Smartstone”, that is the use of a (low-cost) smartphone as a simple, effective, and portable gateway/edge server for mobile healthcare towards cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The Smartstone is designed in order to minimize the user interaction, thanks to its autonomous behavior. The adoption of smart devices as a building block ensures state-of-the-art connectivity and relatively high computational power, complemented by an ensemble of additional onboard sensors. In particular, results about the management of a new photoplethysmographic /bio-impedance monitor and a smart pill dispenser are presented in this work.",

Both ideas are increasingly popular in academic literature. Yet, little is known about their understanding by the practitioners such as policymakers, third sector organisations and citizens. Two case studies, a community-based energy efficiency initiative, and a local authority electric vehicle policy were critically reviewed using discourse analysis. The method helped to reveal the explicit, implied and obscured aims of the examined initiatives. Using discourse analysis, the researchers developed a heuristic which could improve traditional policy analysis approaches. The examination of case studies illustrates how practitioners understand the notions of “urban climate justice” and “smart cities” and whether their conceptualisations differ from those present in the academic literature. Finally, the paper offers methodological suggestions for embedding justice in “smart” initiatives at each stage of policy and project design.",

The approach is based on a justified selection of Barcelona and its four universities. We carry out a deductive and interpretivist method interviewing 19 senior experts whole profiles represent the different forces of the Triple Helix model. Our results show the Barcelona city hall has the objective to implement five main innovative services which are fuelled by six main emerging technologies. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the universities curriculum is not aligned with the city hall's objectives and a gap exists to prepare the undergraduates to the professions required for the Smart City. We recommend six propositions to reshape the University program curricula and leverage the application of Complexity theory to network. The originality of this study is to propose a 3-phases method along with a framework with pre-filled templates and protocols of interviews to analyze universities that pursue the objective to support Smart Cities implementation in a new context of science of cities.",

		"abstract": "IoT (Internet of Things) based smart devices such as sensors have been actively used in edge clouds i.e., ‘fogs’ along with public clouds. They provide critical data during scenarios ranging from e.g., disaster response to in-home healthcare. However, for these devices to work effectively, end-to-end security schemes for the device communication protocols have to be flexible and should depend upon the application requirements as well as the resource constraints at the network-edge. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a flexible IoT security middleware for end-to-end cloud–fog communications involving smart devices and cloud-hosted applications. The novel features of our middleware are in its ability to cope with intermittent network connectivity as well as device constraints in terms of computational power, memory, energy, and network bandwidth. To provide security during intermittent network conditions, we use a ‘Session Resumption’ algorithm in order for our middleware to reuse encrypted sessions from the recent past, if a recently disconnected device wants to resume a prior connection that was interrupted. In addition, we describe an ‘Optimal Scheme Decider’ algorithm that enables our middleware to select the best possible end-to-end security scheme option that matches with a given set of device constraints. Experiment results show how our middleware implementation also provides fast and resource-aware security by leveraging static properties i.e., static pre-shared keys (PSKs) for a variety of IoT-based application requirements that have trade-offs in higher security or faster data transfer rates.",

		"title": "System for monitoring and supporting the treatment of sleep apnea using IoT and big data",
		"abstract": "Sleep apnea has become in the sleep disorder that causes greater concern in recent years due to its morbidity and mortality, higher medical care costs and poor people quality of life. Some proposals have addressed sleep apnea disease in elderly people, but they have still some technical limitations. For these reasons, this paper presents an innovative system based on fog and cloud computing technologies which in combination with IoT and big data platforms offers new opportunities to build novel and innovative services for supporting the sleep apnea and to overcome the current limitations. Particularly, the system is built on several low-power wireless networks with heterogeneous smart devices (i.e, sensors and actuators). In the fog, an edge node (Smart IoT Gateway) provides IoT connection and interoperability and pre-processing IoT data to detect events in real-time that might endanger the elderly’s health and to act accordingly. In the cloud, a Generic Enabler Context Broker manages, stores and injects data into the big data analyzer for further processing and analyzing. The system’s performance and subjective applicability are evaluated using over 30 GB size datasets and a questionnaire fulfilled by medicals specialist, respectively. Results show that the system data analytics improve the health professionals’ decision making to monitor and guide sleep apnea treatment, as well as improving elderly people’s quality of life.",

		"title": "Smart health: Big data enabled health paradigm within smart cities",
		"abstract": "In the era of “big data”, recent developments in the area of information and communication technologies (ICT) are facilitating organizations to innovate and grow. These technological developments and wide adaptation of ubiquitous computing enable numerous opportunities for government and companies to reconsider healthcare prospects. Therefore, big data and smart healthcare systems are independently attracting extensive attention from both academia and industry. The combination of both big data and smart systems can expedite the prospects of the healthcare industry. However, a thorough study of big data and smart systems together in the healthcare context is still absent from the existing literature. The key contributions of this article include an organized evaluation of various big data and smart system technologies and a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art advanced healthcare systems. We describe the three-dimensional structure of a paradigm shift. We also extract three broad technical branches (3T) contributing to the promotion of healthcare systems. More specifically, we propose a big data enabled smart healthcare system framework (BSHSF) that offers theoretical representations of an intra and inter organizational business model in the healthcare context. We also mention some examples reported in the literature, and then we contribute to pinpointing the potential opportunities and challenges of applying BSHSF to healthcare business environments. We also make five recommendations for effectively applying `BSHSF to the healthcare industry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study about state-of-the-art big data and smart healthcare systems in parallel. The managerial implication of this article is that organizations can use the findings of our critical analysis to reinforce their strategic arrangement of smart systems and big data in the healthcare context, and hence better leverage them for sustainable organizational invention.",

		"abstract": "The major challenges facing the 21st century world demands disruptive technology based solutions. One of the most promising exponential technology set to address world challenges is the Internet of Things (IoT) based Trillion Sensor System (TSS). The IoT supports many revolutionary commercial and societal solutions including wearable or unobtrusive medical sensors, Industry 4.0, power and water grids, smart cities, food production, education, transportation and roadway infrastructure needs. However, to support these solutions the current IoT infrastructure needs improved spectrum and the use of between one to ten Trillion Sensors (TS). The development of a robust IoT based TSS infrastructure would create an addition to world GDP equal to that of the U.S. GDP to double the worlds GDP. This new IoT based TSS would create a high paying job base that will form a new vibrant world middle class and an abundant economy. Yet while much is written about the ability of the IoT to transform society little effort is focused on its infrastructure. If this is true there is cause for concern. We add to the literature by developing a precursor road mapping construct which focuses on the service sector and supports 3rd generation road mapping techniques. We utilize the emerging IoT TSS technology base as our case study. We utilize the best thoughts of hundreds of experts from three organizations focused on accelerating IoT TSS road mapping efforts.",

		"abstract": "The world is experiencing an evolution of Smart Cities. These emerge from innovations in information technology that, while they create new economic and social opportunities, pose challenges to our security and expectations of privacy. Humans are already interconnected via smart phones and gadgets. Smart energy meters, security devices and smart appliances are being used in many cities. Homes, cars, public venues and other social systems are now on their path to the full connectivity known as the “Internet of Things.” Standards are evolving for all of these potentially connected systems. They will lead to unprecedented improvements in the quality of life. To benefit from them, city infrastructures and services are changing with new interconnected systems for monitoring, control and automation. Intelligent transportation, public and private, will access a web of interconnected data from GPS location to weather and traffic updates. Integrated systems will aid public safety, emergency responders and in disaster recovery. We examine two important and entangled challenges: security and privacy. Security includes illegal access to information and attacks causing physical disruptions in service availability. As digital citizens are more and more instrumented with data available about their location and activities, privacy seems to disappear. Privacy protecting systems that gather data and trigger emergency response when needed are technological challenges that go hand-in-hand with the continuous security challenges. Their implementation is essential for a Smart City in which we would wish to live. We also present a model representing the interactions between person, servers and things. Those are the major element in the Smart City and their interactions are what we need to protect.",

		"title": "GeoHumanities, GIScience and Smart City Lifeworld approaches to geography and the new human condition",
		"abstract": "The New Human Condition (NHC) is perhaps the largest cognitive challenge in history to human intelligence and agency and concerns our species' ability to cope with the consequences and responsibilities of being the major driver of planetary change in the twenty-first century (Pálsson et al., 2013, Holm et al., 2015). But despite long held assumptions about intra-disciplinary engagements between its “human” and “physical” branches, geography's weakness as a discipline is that it has yet to gather sufficient momentum to collectively shape and implement practical and sustainable climate change policies and actions (Castree, 2014a). However, by considering together the heuristic values of the concepts of the Anthropocene and Planetary Boundaries, the Anglo-American sphere of geography recognizes in either ironic, or unconscious manners that a new strand of environmental determinism (discredited by geographical thought and practice in the early twentieth century) has re-emerged to elide the role of human agency and broadly dominate the discussion of climate change. Mike Hulme (2011, 247) states that “climate determinism” is “a form of analysis and prediction in which climate is first extracted from the matrix of interdependencies that shape human life within the physical world”. Within this discourse it is often the biophysical sphere that is employed to explain the course of human behavior; consequently, this dominating perspective threatens to skew our predictions and understandings of future societies, cultures, climates and destinies. Climate change will certainly constrain human agency, but it also creates the potential for geography to play to its intra and inter disciplinary strengths and begin discussing and addressing human-environmental dilemmas in practical and realistic ways; and secondly, seize the climate change crisis as an opportunity to study where, why and for whom global environmental change matters. Firstly, this paper considers a theoretical balance between the NHC, the Anthropocene and Planetary Boundaries as a way forward for geography to begin addressing the common dilemma of climate change. Within this consideration it engages Anne Buttimer's geographical translation of Martin Heidegger's lebenswelt as a dimension of the NHC. Secondly, the paper discusses how GeoHumanities and GIScience integrations with phenomenology, the digital and environmental humanities and social media generated “Big-Data” can explore the perceptual scales and scopes of the NHC/Anthropocene/Planetary Boundaries conceptual triad. Lastly, it argues that such integrations are salient to the study of emerging Smart City Lifeworlds as a means to engage the increasing urban agencies of global climate change driven by the vagaries of the human condition.",

		"abstract": "In this paper we put forward two ideas for monitoring the Smart Cities initiative in a better way. In developing the first idea, we study past and on-going initiatives in the field of sustainable cities and livable cities and their respective monitoring indicators to demonstrate that not only is a set of indicators needed for efficient monitoring, but also a final synthetic or aggregative index to visualize the initiative's achievements. Specifically, we propose the construction of synthetic indices using principal component analysis (PCA). The second idea attempts to anticipate the changes needed, especially with regard to data collection, to be introduced in current monitoring practices to assess a city's “smartness” accurately. We propose the use of real-time data instead of historical statistics as the basic information with which to construct a set of indicators to explain the initiative. A final index summarizing Smart Cities' real-time set of indicators is suggested in the conclusion.",

		"title": "Energy efficient fog-assisted IoT system for monitoring diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease",
		"abstract": "Blood glucose plays an important role in maintaining body’s activities. For example, brain only uses glucose as its energy source. However, when blood glucose level is abnormal, it causes some serious consequences. For instance, low-blood glucose phenomenon referred to as hypoglycemia can cause heart repolarization and induce cardiac arrhythmia causing sudden cardiac deaths. Diabetes, which can be viewed as a high-blood glucose level for a long period of time, is a dangerous disease as it can directly or indirectly cause heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and other vicious diseases. A solution for reducing the serious consequences caused by diabetes and hypoglycemia is to continuously monitor blood glucose level for real-time responses such as adjusting insulin levels from the insulin pump. Nonetheless, it is a misstep when merely monitoring blood glucose without considering other signals or data such as Electrocardiography (ECG) and activity status since they have close relationships. When hypoglycemia occurs, a fall can easily occur especially in case of people over 65 years old. Fall’s consequences are more hazardous when a fall is not detected. Therefore, we present a Fog-based system for remote health monitoring and fall detection. Through the system, both e-health signals such as glucose, ECG, body temperature and contextual data such as room temperature, humidity, and air quality can be monitored remotely in real-time. By leveraging Fog computing at the edge of the network, the system offers many advanced services such as ECG feature extraction, security, and local distributed storage. Results show that the system works accurately and the wearable sensor node is energy efficient. Even though the node is equipped with many types of sensors, it can operate in a secure way for up to 157 h per a single charge when applying a 1000 mAh Lithium battery.",

		"abstract": "The paper concentrates on tools and technologies used for participatory processes in sustainable urban planning. Scotland’s Place Standard, BREEAM-Communities assessment tool and the Smart City technologies for co-production in urban planning and design are analysed through literature review. Aktivniy Grazhdanin, a citizen engagement portal, established to devolve decision-making on aspects of Moscow’s urban planning to citizens, provides a case study on the potential use of online tools to solicit citizens’ views on the city management and transformation. Tools were selected as they provide participatory frameworks for developing consensus among decision makers and stakeholders on planning strategy, but use different methods - Scotland’s Place Standard initiates a dialogue with interested groups; BREEAM-Communities includes a consultation with stakeholders at a later stage; and Aktivniy Grazhdanin attempts to solicit stakeholders’ views by using online tools. Comprehensive criticism in the research of Kitchin (2014) and Angelidou and Psaltoglou (2017) identified themes around ownership, governance and participation that informed the line of questioning in the case study. The research highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the analysed tools. It recommends how frameworks can be best shaped by such tools to achieve local ownership and provide structure for a more inclusive urban planning.",

		"abstract": "We are living an era in which each of us is immersed in a fully connected environment. The smart devices worn everyday by everyone let the users be projected into the so called IoT world, whose main aim is to provide tools and strategies to solve problems of everyday life as well as to improve well-being and quality of life. Such a goal can be achieved in several ways, but consumer specific services should be provided according to their daily habits, as well as temporary needs. This can be made possible by current mobile devices and their built-in sensors, which can infer the context where the owner operates and the performed activities to build up a user profile. In this work, an architecture for cloud services supply is proposed, based on subject continuous authentication and context (status/activity) recognition. A subject and the context are authenticated/recognised by means of the cyclic recognition of signals captured by the sensors of his/her smartphone, e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope. In order to test the accuracy of the proposed context recognition, the H-MOG dataset has been used, which provides joint acquisitions of status data (Sitting or Walking) related to the activity performed (Reading, Writing, or Navigating Map).",

		"abstract": "Advancements in smart devices, wearable gadgets, sensors, and communication paradigm have enabled the vision of smart cities, pervasive healthcare, augmented reality and interactive multimedia, Internet of Every Thing (IoE), and cognitive assistance, to name a few. All of these visions have one thing in common, i.e., delay sensitivity and instant response. Various new technologies designed to work at the edge of the network, such as fog computing, cloudlets, mobile edge computing, and micro data centers have emerged in the near past. We use the name ``edge computing'' for this set of emerging technologies. Edge computing is a promising paradigm to offer the required computation and storage resources with minimal delays because of ``being near'' to the users or terminal devices. Edge computing aims to bring cloud resources and services at the edge of the network, as a middle layer between end user and cloud data centers, to offer prompt service response with minimal delay. Two major aims of edge computing can be denoted as: (a) minimize response delay by servicing the users’ request at the network edge instead of servicing it at far located cloud data centers, and (b) minimize downward and upward traffic volumes in the network core. Minimization of network core traffic inherently brings energy efficiency and data cost reductions. Downward network traffic can be minimized by servicing set of users at network edge instead of service provider's data centers (e.g., multimedia and shared data) Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and upward traffic can be minimized by processing and filtering raw data (e.g., sensors monitored data) and uploading the processed information to cloud. This survey presents a detailed overview of potentials, trends, and challenges of edge computing. The survey illustrates a list of most significant applications and potentials in the area of edge computing. State of the art literature on edge computing domain is included in the survey to guide readers towards the current trends and future opportunities in the area of edge computing.",

		"abstract": "Energy saving is a hot topic due to the proliferation of climate changes and energy challenges globally. However, people's perception about using smart technology for energy saving is still in the concept stage. This means that people talk about environmental awareness readily, yet in reality, they accept to pay the given energy bill. Due to the availability of electricity and its integral role, modulating consumers’ attitudes towards energy savings can be a challenge. Notably, the gap in today's smart technology design in smart homes is the understanding of consumers’ behaviour and the integration of this understanding into the smart technology. As part of the Paris Climate change agreement (2015), it is paramount for Singapore to introduce smart technologies targeted to reduce energy consumption. This paper focused on the perception of Singapore households on smart technology and its usage to save energy. Areas of current research include: (1) energy consumption in Singapore households, (2) public programs and policies in energy savings, (3) use of technology in energy savings, and (4) household perception of energy savings in smart homes. Furthermore, three case studies are reviewed in relation to smart homes and smart technology, while discussing the maturity of existing solutions.",

		"abstract": "The growing population of senior citizens around the world will appear as a big challenge in the future and they will engage a significant portion of the healthcare facilities. Therefore, it is necessary to develop intelligent healthcare systems so that they can be deployed in smart homes and cities for remote diagnosis. To overcome the problem, an intelligent healthcare system is proposed in this study. The proposed intelligent system is based on the human auditory mechanism and capable of detection and classification of various types of the vocal fold disorders. In the proposed system, critical bandwidth phenomena by using the bandpass filters spaced over Bark scale is implemented to simulate the human auditory mechanism. Therefore, the system acts like an expert clinician who can evaluate the voice of a patient by auditory perception. The experimental results show that the proposed system can detect the pathology with an accuracy of 99.72%. Moreover, the classification accuracy for vocal fold polyp, keratosis, vocal fold paralysis, vocal fold nodules, and adductor spasmodic dysphonia is 97.54%, 99.08%, 96.75%, 98.65%, 95.83%, and 95.83%, respectively. In addition, an experiment for paralysis versus all other disorders is also conducted, and an accuracy of 99.13% is achieved. The results show that the proposed system is accurate and reliable in vocal fold disorder assessment and can be deployed successfully for remote diagnosis. Moreover, the performance of the proposed system is better as compared to existing disorder assessment systems.",

		"abstract": "Progress in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is shaping more and more the healthcare domain. ICTs adoption provides new opportunities, as well as discloses novel and unforeseen application scenarios. As a result, the overall health sector is potentially benefited, as the quality of medical services is expected to be enhanced and healthcare costs are reduced, in spite of the increasing demand due to the aging population. Notwithstanding the above, the scientific literature appears to be still quite scattered and fragmented, also due to the interaction of scientific communities with different background, skills, and approaches. A number of specific terms have become of widespread use (e.g., regarding ICTs-based healthcare paradigms as well as at health-related data formats), but without commonly-agreed definitions. While scientific surveys and reviews have also been proposed, none of them aims at providing a holistic view of how today ICTs are able to support healthcare. This is the more and more an issue, as the integrated application of most if not all the main ICTs pillars is the most agreed upon trend, according to the Industry 4.0 paradigm about ongoing and future industrial revolution. In this paper we aim at shedding light on how ICTs and healthcare are related, identifying the most popular ICTs-based healthcare paradigms, together with the main ICTs backing them. Studying more than 300 papers, we survey outcomes of literature analyses and results from research activities carried out in this field. We characterize the main ICTs-based healthcare paradigms stemmed out in recent years fostered by the evolution of ICTs. Dissecting the scientific literature, we also identify the technological pillars underpinning the novel applications fueled by these technological advancements. Guided by the scientific literature, we review a number of application scenarios gaining momentum thanks to the beneficial impact of ICTs. As the evolution of ICTs enables to gather huge and invaluable data from numerous and highly varied sources in easier ways, here we also focus on the shapes that this healthcare-related data may take. This survey provides an up-to-date picture of the novel healthcare applications enabled by the ICTs advancements, with a focus on their specific hottest research challenges. It helps the interested readership (from both technological and medical fields) not to lose orientation in the complex landscapes possibly generated when advanced ICTs are adopted in application scenarios dictated by the critical healthcare domain.",

		"abstract": "In the supply chain of fresh fruit and vegetables, large losses may incurred throughout the whole farm to fork route. Food supply chain management is faced with challenges of minimizing the post-harvest loss, while delivering the items directly to the refrigerators in smart homes (i.e. domotics). A substantial value can therefore be added to the criterion function by an immediate, real-time detection of changes in perishability dynamics, including a real-time calculation and communication of the remaining shelf life during transportation from one chain node to another. The changes in the estimated remaining shelf life can, therefore, be matched with the expected remaining transportation time, and so the critical moment can be avoided with a given probability. This can be done by dynamic rerouting in real time, based on previous net present value (NPV) criteria. Such criteria could then we include in the contractually stipulated remaining shelf life requirements at the delivery point. This paper focuses on a novel concept of moving activity cells which represent the moving cargo between the fixed activity cells in the extended material requirements planning (EMRP) model. The changes in NPV are calculated dynamically from the expected shelf life changes. Such real-time calculations and early reports are enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, where there is a smart device that tracks ambient conditions like temperature, humidity, and gas concentrations. These early estimations allow a better decision making based on first-expired-first-out (FEFO) cold chain management strategies for perishable products. Therefore, the model includes the possibility to deliver the items to the local market if the expected contractually stipulated shelf-life losses become too high. The paper does not intend to discuss the details of IoT or analyse different sensors, but it wishes to show how the EMRP theory can be used to estimate the changes in NPV when moving activity cells are included in the model. The smart measurement devices embedded in moving activity cells of cyber-physical system measure the ambient data and broadcast decay acceleration factors and postharvest loss of cargo to the decision support system. The numerical example shows how smart measurement devices embedded in moving activity cells of cyber-physical system help to reduce the post-harvest loss in a supply chain by rerouting when necessary. The paper additionally shows how much such a cyber-physical system improves NPV by the development of decision-making processes in the real-time, using the IoT as infrastructure, including automatic rerouting in postharvest logistics.",

The paper does not intend to discuss the details of IoT or analyse different sensors, but it wishes to show how the EMRP theory can be used to estimate the changes in NPV when moving activity cells are included in the model. The smart measurement devices embedded in moving activity cells of cyber-physical system measure the ambient data and broadcast decay acceleration factors and postharvest loss of cargo to the decision support system. The numerical example shows how smart measurement devices embedded in moving activity cells of cyber-physical system help to reduce the post-harvest loss in a supply chain by rerouting when necessary. The paper additionally shows how much such a cyber-physical system improves NPV by the development of decision-making processes in the real-time, using the IoT as infrastructure, including automatic rerouting in postharvest logistics.",

		"title": "Network State Conservation in Dynamic Spectrum Access: the IEEE 802.11 DCF Case",
		"abstract": "The paper is on improving spectral efficiency in dynamic spectrum access (DSA). The proliferation of wireless devices has been straining the limited radio spectrum in recent years. The spectrum shortage problem will deteriorate as the ideas of Internet of things (IoT) and smart communities are gaining attention and acceptance. It is thus important to improve spectral efficiency in DSA, one of the most promising techniques addressing the spectrum shortage problem. One perspective to improving spectral efficiency in DSA is to study the impact of a cognitive-radio (CR) physical layer on the upper layers, such as the medium access control (MAC) sub-layer. A CR physical layer coupled with DSA may interrupt the activities at an upper layer at any given time, which can be costly in terms of spectral efficiency. For example, when a CR physical layer interrupts the ACK transmission in a RTS-CTS-DATA-ACK cycle of the IEEE 802.11 DCF, the spectrum used for accomplishing the RTS-CTS-DATA exchange are totally wasted, impairing spectral efficiency in the second user (SU) network. This type of spectrum waste caused by a CR physical layer in DSA can be reduced by the idea of network state conservation (NSC). Basically, second users with NSC conserve their protocol state information when the signal of primary user (PU) arrives in the channel. When the channel becomes available again for the SUs, they use their conserved network states to resume their protocol cycle from where it was interrupted by the PU’s signal, instead of starting the whole cycle over. We show that NSC can significantly improve the spectrum efficiency of an SU network of IEEE 802.11 DCF nodes, and the gain in spectrum efficiency increases with the intensity of the PU’s traffic.",

		"abstract": "This paper briefly explores the expected impact of the ‘Global Drivers’ (such as population demographics, food security; energy security; community security and safety), and the role of sustainability engineering in mitigating the potential effects of these Global Drivers. The message of the paper is that sustainability requires a significant input from Ergonomics/Human Factors, but the profession needs some expansion in its thinking in order to make this contribution. Creating a future sustainable world in which people experience an acceptable way of life will not happen without a large input from manufacturing industry into all the Global Drivers, both in delivering products that meet sustainability criteria (such as durability, reliability, minimised material requirement and low energy consumption), and in developing sustainable processes to deliver products for sustainability (such as minimum waste, minimum emissions and low energy consumption). Appropriate changes are already being implemented in manufacturing industry, including new business models, new jobs and new skills. Considerable high-level planning around the world is in progress and is bringing about these changes; for example, there is the US ‘Advanced Manufacturing National Program’ (AMNP)’, the German ‘Industrie 4.0’ plan, the French plan ‘la nouvelle France industrielle’ and the UK Foresight publications on the ‘Future of Manufacturing’. All of these activities recognise the central part that humans will continue to play in the new manufacturing paradigms; however, they do not discuss many of the issues that systems ergonomics professionals acknowledge. This paper discusses a number of these issues, highlighting the need for some new thinking and knowledge capture by systems ergonomics professionals. Among these are ethical issues, job content and skills issues. Towards the end, there is a summary of knowledge extensions considered necessary in order that systems ergonomists can be fully effective in this new environment, together with suggestions for the means to acquire and disseminate the knowledge extensions.",

		"abstract": "This paper evaluates smart city (SC) initiatives in the context of re-using vacant property, focusing on the role of living labs (LL). LL utilise Lo-Fi technologies to foster local digital innovation and support community-focused civic hacking, running various kinds of workshops and engaging with local citizens to co-create digital interventions and apps aimed at ‘solving’ local issues. Five approaches to LL are outlined and discussed in relation to vacancy and gentrification: pop-up initiatives, university-led activities, community organised venues/activities, citizen sensing and crowdsourcing, and tech-led regeneration initiatives. Notwithstanding the potential for generating temporary and independent spaces for transferring digital competences and increasing citizens' participation in the SC, we argue LL foster largely a form of participation framed within a model of civic stewardship for ‘smart citizens’. While presented as horizontal, open, and participative, LL and civic hacking are rooted often in pragmatic and paternalistic discourses and practices related to the production of a creative economy and a technocratic version of SC. As such, by encouraging a particular kind of re-use of vacant space, LLs are used actively to bolster the Smart City discourse, as part of the more general neoliberalization of urban political economy. We discuss these approaches and issues generally, drawing on previous fieldwork and with respect to a case study of Dublin, Ireland.",

The results of the comprehensive literature review indicate that the discussions on smart aging in the scientific publications are by and large classified into the following three directions: Technologies, Aging Medical Care, and Behavior and Social.

Apparent effects on both society and individual livelihoods will continue to increase in the coming decades. Great hopes are projected on technology to support solutions for the ageing society and urban planning. Smart city strategies and the field of ambient assisted living are two concepts sharing the assumption that technology will make our lives more independent, more efficient and safer with a higher quality of life. This paper presents a case study of a participatory foresight project that investigates how transdisciplinary agenda setting through the means of including citizens, experts and stakeholders can provide orientation for long-term planning on the future of ageing in the city. Results enforce the argument that urban governance needs to address additional tasks whilst adapting to challenges arising from ageing societies and urbanisation. Alongside mere technological innovation, human factors gain importance. Future-oriented urban development strategies need to incorporate this fact and should not predominantly be drafted on the paradigm of technological progress.",

		"abstract": "This article aims to understand the governance of city food systems in Bangkok by drawing attention to: the participatory aspect of Bangkok's city food governance; the food production that emerges from the sustainable growth and inclusive nature of this governance system; and civil society's use of this as an activism able to empower communities and for such movements to be smart in bridging territorial divisions, by way local government strategies, secured through capacity-building exercises. The multitude of stakeholders involved in governing Bangkok's food system is not just inter-related, but also linked and connected from top-to-bottom. These stakeholders include central and local governments, large food corporations, civil society organizations and even the daily life practices of street food venders and mobile markets. As a result, the article suggests, the governance of the city food agenda in Bangkok is both empowered and participatory, because organizations from the top and the middle are unable to sustain the development of food systems without including ordinary people in the actions taken to create them. This suggests legal frameworks, plans and related infrastructure development, are insufficient for Bangkok be smart in sustaining the development of cities food systems. As while the public sector facilitates food production and distribution through the regionalization process (including the conservation of the peri-urban agriculture, irrigation systems development, and central fresh food markets establishment), the smart city food agenda still requires operations from below to sustain such technical innovations.",

		"abstract": "Confidentiality of health information is indispensable to protect privacy of an individual. However, recent advances in electronic healthcare systems allow transmission of sensitive information through the Internet, which is prone to various vulnerabilities, attacks and may leads to unauthorized disclosure. Such situations may not only create adverse effects for individuals but may also cause severe consequences such as hefty regulatory fines, bad publicity, legal fees, and forensics. To avoid such predicaments, a privacy protected healthcare system is proposed in this study that protects the identity of an individual as well as detects vocal fold disorders. The privacy of the developed healthcare system is based on the proposed zero-watermarking algorithm, which embeds a watermark in a secret key instead of the signals to avoid the distortion in an audio sample. The identity is protected by the generation of its secret shares through visual cryptography. The generated shares are embedded by finding the patterns into the audio with the application of one-dimensional local binary pattern. The proposed zero-watermarking algorithm is evaluated by using audio samples taken from the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary voice disorder database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves imperceptibility and is reliable in its extraction of identity. In addition, the proposed algorithm does not affect the results of disorder detection and it is robust against noise attacks of various signal-to-noise ratios.",

		"abstract": "In 2016, the World Health Organization declared that ‘Health is one of the most effective markers of any city’s successful sustainable development’ (World Health Organisation, 2016). With estimates that around 6.7 billion people will live in cities by 2050, 21st century city planning decisions will play a critical role in achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They will determine the city structure and access to health-enhancing (or health-damaging) urban environments, and ultimately lifestyle choices that impact both individual and planetary health. Benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating city planning policies and interventions is therefore critical to optimise urban outcomes. In 2017, the UN adopted a global SDG indicator framework, calling for complementary national and regional indicators to be collected by member countries. UN Habitat has also developed an indicator action framework specifically for cities. This paper examined the extent to which the UN indicators will help cities evaluate their efforts to deliver sustainability and health outcomes. It identified inconsistencies between the two UN indicator frameworks. Many of the SDG indicators assess outcomes, rather than the comprehensive and integrated ‘upstream’ policies and interventions required to deliver outcomes on-the-ground. Conversely, the UN Habitat framework incorporates intervention indicators, but excludes health outcome indicators. A more comprehensive approach to benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating policies designed to achieve healthy and sustainable cities and assessing spatial inequities is proposed.",

The role and job profile of employees in the smart factories will change in the future and it will be increasingly challenging for SMEs to compete with large corporations in the fight for skilled workers.

This paper provides an overview of the USDG and explores some of the difficulties around using this goal as a tool for improving cities. We argue that challenges emerge around selecting the indicators in the first place and also around the practical use of these indicators once selected. Three main practical problems of indicator use include 1) the poor availability of standardized, open and comparable data 2) the lack of strong data collection institutions at the city scale to support monitoring for the USDG and 3) “localization” - the uptake and context specific application of the goal by diverse actors in widely different cities. Adding to the complexity, the USDG conversation is taking place at the same time as the proliferation of a bewildering array of indicator systems at different scales. Prompted by technological change, debates on the “data revolution” and “smart city” also have direct bearing on the USDG. We argue that despite these many complexities and challenges, the USDG framework has the potential to encourage and guide needed reforms in our cities but only if anchored in local institutions and initiatives informed by open, inclusive and contextually sensitive data collection and monitoring.",

The paper aims to explore effective measures and strategies for the promotion of ICT-enabled innovations for the elderly and people with special needs.
Methods
The paper begins by reviewing current government initiatives in the field of e-health and accessibility that are addressing challenges faced by Japan's rapidly ageing society. It then evaluates the results of Japanese government efforts in the promotion of ICT solutions for its older population against the availability of special infrastructure, device interfaces, and services and applications that meet five essential needs of the elderly with regard to quality of life in highly developed countries.
Results and conclusion
The results of the study suggest that more efforts are needed to exploit ICT to transform all domains of society in order to meet the challenges produced by a rapidly ageing population. For that purpose the paper proposes 12 main areas in which to facilitate ICT innovations for an ageing population. It then outlines a number of strategic directions for the formulation of specific measures that will place Japan in the forefront of societal transformation.",

		"abstract": "Climate change and its impacts cannot be addressed once for all due to internal complexity. Some implemented strategies may only be capable of dealing with a cluster of problems while leaving many others untouched. The co-benefits approach, however, opens up a ‘window of opportunity’ via achieving multi-goals simultaneously. Based on this, this paper aims to unpack the interrelationship between the struggling urban heat island (UHI) issue and the already ongoing sponge city (SPC) projects in China. Specifically, the co-benefits are investigated from technical, financial, institutional and social perspectives, after which pathways to implementation are presented. In these aspects, the co-benefits approach can bring opportunities for implementing SPC and UHI mitigation. The inclusion of UHI mitigation into SPC construction can enhance public participation and thereby consolidate the public-private partnership model for funds. During the co-benefits approach implementation, the weights of different authorities can be rebalanced to promote institutional transitions. SPC-derived UHI mitigation approach, potentially realising synergies of urban flooding and UHI mitigation, can be a model for countries which have already released low-impact development water management practices, and may also provide references for other projects such as green building, low-carbon eco-city, smart city, forest city and haze treatment for UHI mitigation.",

However, there is a lack of comparative studies of smart governance in different institutional contexts. This study develops a framework for comparing smart governance in different institutional and technological contexts. Comparative and discourse analyses are conducted to understand the similarities and differences of smart governance practices in selected Western countries and China. A key finding of this study is that different institutions have largely affected smart governance strategies, arrangements and outcomes. Smart governance is tightly linked with e-governance and e-democracy in some Western countries, while it officially emphasizes smart management and service in China. A common aspect is that the increasing use of social media, smartphones, portals, crowdsourcing platforms, and planning support systems have generally promoted smart governments and services, e-participation, and wider collaboration through both top-down and bottom-up approaches. This could lead to gradual changes in government organizations, new relations between governments, the private sector and citizens, and improvements in the city.",

Smart environments, which are spaces unobtrusively equipped with sensors and actuators, providing ambient services to the people living within. Mobile robots inside those smart environments can use the existing infrastructure to increase their performance while decreasing the cost of local sensor systems. On the other side, evaluation of ambient services is often a laborious task. This work presents an approach that simplifies the evaluation by making use of two frameworks from robotics to perform tests in simulated smart environments. A method based on the language as action principle is used to extract realistic behavior of people living in real-world smart environments. Using this data, many different scenarios with varying configurations (different floor layouts, numbers and types of sensors, different number of people and pets) can easily be simulated and the performance of the ambient services evaluated.",

		"abstract": "The recent development in the field of embedded devices, such as sensors, actuators, and smartphones, etc. is providing a great business potential towards the new era of web of things (WoT); in which all the capillary devices (electronic devices) are capable of interconnecting and communicating with each other over the Internet. Therefore, web technologies provide a way towards integrating and sharing a common communication medium. However, for integrating Cyber–Physical System (CPS) and WoT, a comprehensive architecture and platform is still missing. Therefore, this paper proposes the concept of Smart Cyber Society; propelling the concept of smart home. We then propose the virtual communication platform that is composed of six functional communication layers, which provides a common medium for communication, i.e., same communication language. In addition, a system architecture for smart cyber society is also proposed, which consists of three networked domains, such as cyber home domain (networked-home), cyber society domain (networked of various societies, i.e., hospitals, police station, and fire brigade), and cyber mobile domain (networked of vehicles). Furthermore, the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are implemented on Hadoop single node setup on UBUNTU 14.04 LTS coreTMi5 machine with 3.2 GHz processor and 4 GB memory. Sample medical, sensory datasets and fire detection datasets are tested on the proposed system. Finally, the results show that the proposed system architecture efficiently processes, analyzes, and integrates different datasets efficiently and triggers actions to provide safety measurements for elderly age people, vehicles and others.",

		"title": "European smart home market development: Public views on technical and economic aspects across the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy",
		"abstract": "Smart homes will enable the new services and capabilities offered via smart grids and smart cities to be realized by householders. Yet, whilst there is a wealth of research on smart grids’ contribution to achieving Europe's ambitious climate change and energy policy goals, smart homes are not studied to the same extent. The aim of this paper is to illustrate differences and similarities in technical and economic drivers and barriers to smart home market development in three European countries characterized by different policy and socio-economic contexts. The research reveals key barriers to the adoption of smart homes such as reliability, data privacy, and costs of smart home technologies across the countries studied. On the other hand, housing stock characteristics, both age of buildings and tenure, reveal deeper cross-country differences in attitudes and perceptions towards these technologies. The research highlights the need for smart home services that go beyond energy consumption and management services. Only when such a holistic approach is adopted, where other applications such as health or security, suited to the householders’ needs and making positive contribution to their daily lives, are enabled, will the benefits of smart homes become clear to the consumer.",

		"title": "Towards modern sustainable cities: Review of sustainability principles and trends",
		"abstract": "Human capital development, attractions of sustainable living standards and renewed concerns for the planet have redirected city planners to a new frontier: the creation of sustainable cities. This is evident in some initiatives taken to create cities with low to zero carbon emissions, build sustainable structures and create higher institutions of learning where sustainability practices are entrenched in their curricula. Examples of the forerunners of sustainable cities are abound; from the Middle East (Education City in Qatar and Masdar City in Abu Dhabi) to Far East (Dongtan Institute in China and New Songdo City in South Korea), new cities imbued with sustainability practices are springing forth. There are 400 big cities and 23 mega cities presently occupying the world urban spaces, with estimates of about one and 10 million inhabitants, respectively. Ironically cities occupy about 2% of the earth surface, they however consume 60–80% of global energy. The global urban population rose from 220 million to about 2.8 billion in the 20th century, and it is projected that by 2050, this will increase to 6.9 billion, which is about 70% of the world population. Therefore, sustainability campaigns, when directed at cities, would have intended impacts due to a number of factors associated with cities: large population, hub of intellectual and social integration, high consumption, etc. In creating modern sustainable cities however, the attention of cities' planners and policymakers alike should be on those goals that come under the banner of sustainability, especially when designing new or retrofitting existing human settlements (the cities); such as human capital development, energy conservation and energy efficiency, water security, efficient use of earth-abundant resources, transportation, building standards, social and economic equity, and food wastes management. Although there are few review articles in the literature that separately deal with individual sustainability fundamentals, there is a dearth of publication consolidating key sustainability principles required for modern cities. This paper reviewed each element needed to make a functional sustainable city. We adopted a simple approach; we explained each sustainability principle, highlighted its core values and gave reasons why it is an important candidate to be considered in making a working city. We critiqued the current sustainable cities by stating reasons for their strengths and explanations for their deficiencies. We engaged the future sustainable cities’ planners to learn from the failures of some of the earlier hurriedly executed sustainable cities in order to have the most important elements of sustainability present in their future project execution.",

Cities and countries around the world have begun to realize that these events are no longer “hundred year” storms, but repeat within a few years. As urbanisation continues throughout this century, more and more people and more economic activity will be concentrated in at-risk areas; especially as new arrivals in cities throughout Asia and Africa are likely to be concentrated in the highest risk districts, much as they often are in North America and Europe today. This article reviews recent growth of natural disasters and considers how a systems approach can improve approaches to mitigation and adaptation of these risks and to recovery from such events.",

		"title": "Autonomous vehicles: theoretical and practical challenges",
		"abstract": "Autonomous driving is expected to revolutionize road traffic attenuating current externalities, especially accidents and congestion. Carmakers, researchers and administrations have been working on autonomous driving for years and significant progress has been made. However, the doubts and challenges to overcome are still huge, as the implementation of an autonomous driving environment encompasses not only complex automotive technology, but also human behavior, ethics, traffic management strategies, policies, liability, etc. As a result, carmakers do not expect to commercially launch fully driverless vehicles in the short-term. From the technical perspective, the unequivocal detection of obstacles at high speeds and long distances is one of the greatest difficulties to face. Regarding traffic management strategies, all approaches share the vision that vehicles should behave cooperatively. General V2V cooperation and platooning are options being discussed, both with multiple variants. Various strategies, built from different standpoints, are being designed and validated using simulation. Besides, legal issues have already been arisen in the context of highly-automated driving. They range from the need for special driving licenses to much more intricate topics like liability in the event of an accident or privacy issues. All these legal and ethical concerns could hinder the spread of autonomous vehicles once technologically feasible. This paper provides an overview of the current state of the art in the key aspects of autonomous driving. Based on the information received in situ from top research centers in the field and on a literature review, authors highlight the most important advances and findings reached so far, discuss different approaches regarding autonomous traffic and propose a framework for future research.",

		"abstract": "Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is leading towards a new and more advanced paradigm that is Internet of Everything (IoE). Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), which aims to support elderly and physically challenged persons, is based on sensor networks. WSNs are mostly installed for a particular single application. Though, future of WSNs hides in WSN virtualization, which supports multiple applications. The aggregation of the sensor network resources in the form of software or hardware are supported by WSN virtualization. In Virtualizing WSN, the role of middleware layer is of supreme importance. However, a middleware layer faces overhead challenges of high processing time, delay, and the power consumption. The major challenge faced by AAL application in the paradigm of WSN virtualization is the delay caused by the aggregation of the sensed data. In this research paper efforts have been made to design a priority based multi-threading middleware design for sensor virtualization. The proposed middleware resides at the sensor node as well as the gateway that reduces the delay caused by the sensor virtualization. The proposed middleware design has been implemented and tested on the AAL testbed.",

		"abstract": "The paper examines the current trends in Indian urbanization, a country known to be the second most populous country in the world. It aims to explore whether India, with its prevailing urban physical infrastructure bottlenecks and targeted policies to overcome the same, is equipped enough to sustain a growing urban population. Due to the excessive concentration of population in cities, the link between urbanization and development has evolved as a critical concern for policy makers. The paper employs a situation-actor-process (SAP) - learning-action-performance (LAP) [SAP-LAP] model of inquiry to assess the state of urban physical infrastructure in India and indicates future actions necessary from the standpoint of reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target of inclusive, consistent, sustainable and resilient infrastructure to bolster economic progress and social welfare, with an emphasis on affordable and even-handed access to all. There has been paucity of studies in the recent past which explore government's role in recognizing physical infrastructure as a sustaining factor to urbanization and its paradoxical policy response—excessive zeal on the one hand and extreme apathy on the other—to urban development issues. The SAP-LAP framework shall assist systemic exploration of various issues in India's urbanization, with specific emphasis on physical infrastructure. This holistic approach would enable to identify further actions to realize sustainable growth and livability benefits of urbanization for India.",

Designing a context-aware system able to provide the most tailored services to users according to their behaviors, preferences and needs is still a research challenge. In such environments, although the context is very complex, dynamic and full of data captured and produced, users aspire to automatically receive contextualized services. The Cultural Heritage domain represents a domain where exchanged and produced data can be opportunely exploited by a set of applications and services in order to transform a static space into a smart environment. In this perspective, this paper presents a context-aware system named Context Evolution System (CES) able to represent and manage the evolution of the context through its instances; such an evolution is driven by occurring events and opportunely modeled by a graph structure. To assess the proposed solution, a Cultural Heritage case study of a real temporary art exhibition named the Beauty or the Truth and located in Naples (Italy) is presented and discussed.",

		"abstract": "While autonomous mobility technology is developing, comparatively less is known about how a sociotechnical system of autonomous mobility may impact our urban living conditions. Using Finland as a case study, this research aims to identify the possible implications of changing power relations created by autonomous mobility technology. This study uses a theoretical and conceptual approach grounded in the planning research tradition of Aristotelian practical judgement (phronesis). Drawing from political theory of technology, it investigates the social relations that may be afforded by autonomous mobility technology. Adapting a concept drawn from geography of power, it examines how power is expressed in terms of transcripts of dominant technological agency and hidden social context. 31 interviews of extended users in the transition (intermediaries) revealed three dominant transcripts of technological agency associated with the philosophy of cyberlibertarianism (liberation of the driver, safety of the driver and customer accessibility), and four hidden transcripts of social context (restrictions on sharing street space, loss of social safety, vulnerability of passengers, and loss of privacy). The phronetic research tradition that was used in the study revealed several things. The impact of autonomous mobility technology goes beyond the purely systemic, affecting the very fabric of our connection with place and society. Failure to consider autonomous mobility technology as a sociotechnical system that will restructure society unperceptively (technological somnambulism) may bring profound societal changes.",

		"abstract": "The autonomous vehicle innovation has a potential effect on traffic and it’s a widespread issue in the academic municipal. Based on its feature, autonomous vehicle is expected to improve traffic flow, reduce accidents, reduce social exclusion and improve the utility of time on travel. It is increasingly accepted that the next step to the evolution of human transportation is the replacement of human as the driver by the Artificial-intelligence-capable machine. Regardless, the challenges remain especially in convincing the consumers to switch to autonomous cars despite the apparent benefits. In the past, papers highlighted individual trust toward machine as the key point to encourage acceptance of autonomous cars. This paper seeks to highlight the ethical implications of the autonomous technology and how it is related to the user acceptance of the technology. This paper reviewed recent studies on the ethical implications of the autonomous vehicle and the user acceptance of the technology. A systematic review of papers from the literature was done using Scopus, ISI and Web of Science. The results of the review have shown that the level of trust, which may vary on the sociodemographic profile of the users, has been studied as one of the factors for user acceptance. Many researchers also highlight ethical implication as an important aspect of autonomous technology that needs to be tended to. The researcher proposes that ethical implication can be an important element of user trust toward autonomous technology. Hence, there is a need to embed ethical implication as a construct for user trust leading to user acceptance model in future studies. In the line of this research review researcherwas addressedthe following comprehensive groups: examination of autonomous vehicle topographies and flexibility prototypes, consequences for street traffic and connectivity to substructure (specifically in the urban areas with the medium and low density), communal attitudes and apprehensions, transportable behaviour and plea, possible business models, and strategy implications.

		"abstract": "Following World War II, Japan miraculously developed into an economic powerhouse and a model of energy efficiency among developed countries. This lasted more than 65 years until the Northeastern Japan earthquake and tsunami induced nuclear crisis of March 2011 brought Japan to an existential crossroads. Instead of implementing its plans to increase nuclear power generation capacity from thirty percent to fifty percent, Japan shut-down all fifty-four nuclear reactors for safety checks and stress-checks (two have since been restarted), resulting in reduced power generation during the summer of 2012. The reconstruction of Northeastern Japan approaches at a time when the world is grappling with a transition to sustainable energy technologies—one that will require substantial investment but one that would result in fundamental changes in infrastructure and energy efficiency. Certain reconstruction methods can be inappropriate in the social, cultural and climatic context of disaster affected areas. Thus, how can practitioners employ sustainable reconstructions which better respond to local housing needs and availability of natural energy resources without a framework in place? This paper aims at sensitizing policy-makers and stakeholders involved in post disaster reconstruction by recognizing advantages of deploying sustainable energy technologies, to reduce dependence of vulnerable communities on external markets.",

		"abstract": "The twenty-first century will witness massive urban expansion and growth of the urban population, which has global implications for future pathways of sustainable development. Addressing new and heightened demands on the environment, energy resources, and infrastructure will require holistic comprehension and actionable approaches to the city as the nexus of environmental context, built infrastructure, and human communities through interdisciplinary collaboration. Yet urban sustainability is a vague and elusive concept that fails to inspire actionable and effective actions; to teach urban sustainability is an even more daunting task, which requires drastic changes to conventional pedagogical structures and processes. This paper describes the experiences of a university course to prepare students with diverse academic backgrounds to develop the skills to understand and address challenges in urban sustainability. The course is jointly offered by three academic programs at Tsinghua University and Stanford University and uses Beijing and the Bay Area as two case studies. Experimenting with a combination of teaching principles that are critical to cultivate young professionals, this course offers a unique cross-cultural and interdisciplinary educational experience that allows students to explore urban sustainability topics ranging from air quality to urban mobility, heritage buildings, and energy conservation in consultation with local experts, scholars, and non-governmental organizations. Lessons detailed in this paper can benefit the development of similar courses around the world to foster higher education in urban sustainability.",

In this context, engineers should be provided with proper modeling and programming abstractions to develop applications able to benefit from Future Internet, by being at the same time fluid, as well as dependable. Indeed, such abstractions should (i) facilitate the development of autonomous and independent interacting resources (loose coupling), (ii) deal with the run-time variability of the application in terms of involved resources (flexibility), (iii) provide mechanisms for run-time resources discovery and access (dynamism), and (iv) enable the running application to accommodate unforeseen resources (serendipity). To this end, Prime (P-Rest at design/run tIME) defines the P-REST architectural style, and a set of P-REST oriented modeling and programming abstractions to provide engineers with both design-time and run-time support for specifying, implementing and operating P-RESTful applications.",

		"abstract": "Current urban planning for sustainability is gradually shifting from car-based to proximity ideals. However, when concretized in regular planning thinking and practice, the latter ideal becomes contested and complex. This paper explores sustainable accessibility and how urban planners understand, seek to operationalize, and integrate the concept in their planning practices; we consider what planners hope to achieve in this process and the tensions they experience in doing so. The data, collected through semi-structured, focus-group interviews (workshops) with 35 planners in three Swedish municipalities, were subjected to thematic qualitative analysis. Urban planners' interpretations of sustainable accessibility form five recurrent themes: the importance of cross-sectoral approaches in planning; the need for urban land-use densification; measures to shift the transport mode balance in favour of walking, cycling, and public transit; facilitating proximity to everyday activities; and planning in accordance with citizens' rights to access basic services. Although there is overall agreement on these themes, discussing how the related policies should be implemented reveals several tensions, for example: city centre densification could reinforce gentrification, resulting in displacement and increased travel; tension regarding to what extent and where car use should be reduced; trade-offs between the needs of different groups; and accounting for quality and functionality factors when stressing the importance of proximity to services. In conclusion, disagreements arising when implementing sustainable accessibility goals relate in many ways to social considerations and to the socio–spatial distribution of resources.",

		"abstract": "With the growing availability of public open data, the protection of citizens’ privacy has become a vital issue for governmental data publishing. However, there are a large number of operational risks in the current government cloud platforms. When the cloud platform is attacked, most existing privacy protection models for data publishing cannot resist the attacks if the attacker has prior background knowledge. Potential attackers may gain access to the published statistical data, and identify specific individual’s background information, which may cause the disclosure of citizens’ private information. To address this problem, we propose a fog-computing-based differential privacy approach for privacy-preserving data publishing in this paper. We discuss the risk of citizens’ privacy disclosure related to governmental data publishing, and present a differential privacy framework for publishing governmental statistical data based on fog computing. Based on the framework, a data publishing algorithm using a MaxDiff histogram is developed, which can be used to realize the function of preserving user privacy based on fog computing. Applying the differential method, Laplace noises are added to the original data set, which prevents citizens’ privacy from disclosure even if attackers get strong background knowledge. According to the maximum frequency difference, the adjacent data bins are grouped, then the differential privacy histogram with minimum average error can be constructed. We evaluate the proposed approach by computational experiments based on the real data set of Philippine families’ income and expenditures provided by Kaggle. It shows that the proposed data publishing approach can not only effectively protect citizens’ privacy, but also reduce the query sensitivity and improve the utility of the data published.",

		"abstract": "The shift towards capacity building and deteriorating governance, may lead to poor service delivery which is a prime challenge for governing agencies. Different countries follow their own sets of governance parameters and often assess the outcome of policies based on them. In order to compose a uniform good governance framework, we have conducted a comparative analysis among 22 existing governance frameworks across the globe and shortlisted 13 major criteria along with 74 sub-criteria. We explored the method to measure these governance components with the help of various indicators and took expert opinion to distribute weight among these indicators. Finally, the case of Mumbai city is discussed with the examples of direct indicators, which may be used to measure a sub-criteria of any specific criteria. The quantification process is also demonstrated with three specific representative indicators. For example- the contribution towards good-governance has been increased from 0.001218 in 2016 to 0.004466 in 2017, for the indicator “conviction percentage of corruption cases” of sub-criterion “active anti-corruption commission” of criterion “accountability”.

		"abstract": "The introduction of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) into cities may fundamentally transform the design and use of cities. On one hand, AVs offer the potential to reduce the urban space requirements for roads and parking, creating more space for high-quality, liveable areas. On the other hand, greater motorisation and the availability to perform leisure or work activities while travelling in AVs could increase the number of trips and travel distances, encouraging urban traffic congestion and sprawl. These diverse, and sometimes conflicting, estimates and opinions give rise to considerable uncertainty among urban policy decision-makers, sometimes leading to planning inaction. This paper aims to shed light on the opportunities that AVs offer in delivering attractive, healthy and sustainable urbanisation patterns. This paper employs a backcasting approach to investigate whether and how the potential impacts of AV implementation can support or threaten a range of urban development policy goals. This approach enables conflicts between policy goals to be identified. The findings point to the need for mixed-use development policy, the clustering of urban facilities and services, the restriction of motorized access in cities and the adoption of shared high-quality multimodal transport.",

		"abstract": "Characterizing human mobility patterns is essential for understanding human behaviors and the interactions with socioeconomic and natural environment, and plays a critical role in public health, urban planning, transportation engineering and related fields. With the widespread of location-aware mobile devices and continuing advancement of Web 2.0 technologies, location-based social media (LBSM) have been gaining widespread popularity in the past few years. With an access to locations of hundreds of million users, profiles and the contents of the social media posts, the LBSM data provided a novel modality of data source for human mobility study. By exploiting the explicit location footprints and mining the latent demographic information implied in the LBSM data, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of human mobility with a particular focus on the impact of demography. To serve this purpose, we first collect geo-tagged Twitter feeds posted in the conterminous United States area, and organize the collection of feeds using the concept of space-time trajectory corresponding to each Twitter user. Commonly human mobility measures, including detected home and activity centers, are derived for each user trajectory. We then select a subset of Twitter users that have detected home locations in the city of Chicago as a case study, and apply name analysis to the names provided in user profiles to learn the implicit demographic information of Twitter users, including race/ethnicity, gender and age. Finally we explore the spatiotemporal distribution and mobility characteristics of Chicago Twitter users, and investigate the demographic impact by comparing the differences across three demographic dimensions (race/ethnicity, gender and age). We found that, although the human mobility measures of different demographic groups generally follow the generic laws (e.g., power law distribution), the demographic information, particular the race/ethnicity group, significantly affects the urban human mobility patterns.",

		"abstract": "Due to increased life expectancy, the prevalence of cognitive decline related to neurodegenerative diseases and to non-neurological conditions is increasing in western countries. As with other diseases, the burden might be reduced through personalized interventions delivered at early stages of the disease. Thus, there is an increasing demand, from both social and healthcare systems, for instruments and strategies to recognize cognitive decline, and possibly distinguish the precursor of serious neurodegeneration from “benign senile forgetfulness” or the temporary consequences of illness or trauma. However, this goal faces both technical and ethical issues. In this article we deal with the following: (i) re-definition of cognitive decline and its relationship with frailty definitions, starting from the recent work of international consensus groups for presymptomatic Alzheimer disease recognition; (ii) ethical problems concerning anonymous and personalized cognitive screening and the need for appropriate counselling; (iii) the need for more sensitive and specific tools to detect and distinguish pathological levels of cognitive decline and delineate the contribution of non-pathological decline to accumulated frailty impacts and (iv) the potential of the language domain and spontaneous speech analyses.",

		"abstract": "Existing debates suggest that resettlement leads to exclusion of the urban poor from the city, linked to interrupted livelihoods and lack of accessibility to the city. This paper analyses the ways in which public transport mobility plays a role in the livelihood strategies of women living in a resettlement area at the fringe of Chennai, India. The main question addressed is how women exercise agency in embedding spatial practices within their livelihood strategies to reconnect to the city. The analysis is based on 4months fieldwork in Semmencherry Resettlement Area in Chennai (India). It combines a qualitative analysis with a spatial exploration drawing on concepts from debates on the livelihoods approach, spatial practices, and accessibility and transport-related exclusion. Results show that the more agency women have to negotiate livelihoods strategies, the better they can take complex decisions on accessing resources over large distances and minimizing their adverse effects. We argue that combining a livelihood with a spatial analysis is important because it shows how spatial exclusion has to be assessed according to women's own priorities and decisions concerning spatial practices as part of livelihoods strategies. Accessibility and recreating relational spaces may both widen women's opportunities as well as overstretch their physical and financial resources.",

		"abstract": "Agent-based simulators (ABSs) have successfully allowed practitioners to estimate the outcomes of certain input circumstances in several domains. Although some techniques and processes provide hints about the construction of these systems, some aspects have not been discussed yet in the literature. In this context, the current approach presents a technique for developing ABSs. Its focus is to guide practitioners in designing and implementing the decision-making processes of agents in nondeterministic scenarios. As an additional technological innovation, the ABSs are deployed as both mobile apps and online tools. This work illustrates the current approach with two case studies in the fields of (a) health and welfare and (b) tourism. These case studies have also been developed with the most similar technique from the literature for comparing both techniques. The presented technique improved the simulated outcomes in terms of their similarity with the real ones. The obtained ABSs were more efficient and reliable for large amounts of agents (e.g. 10,000 – 400,000 agents). The development time was lower. Both the framework and the implementation of a case study are freely distributed as open-source to facilitate the reproducibility of the experiments and to assist practitioners in applying the current approach.",

		"abstract": "Governments are well on their way to realizing many of the efficiency gains and administrative improvements promised by traditional e-government. Leveraging this mature infrastructure, Taiwan and other leading implementers have begun to explore ways to harness IT innovations beyond efficiency to also alter how government delivers services and solves public problems. Accordingly, Taiwan's fourth e-government strategy includes a notable commitment to “proactive” service and information delivery. The aim is to flip the service delivery model by shifting from the “pull” approach of traditional e-government—whereby the citizen must seek out government services—towards a “push” model, whereby government proactively and seamlessly delivers just-in-time services to citizens shaped around their individual needs, preferences, circumstance, and location. The article explores Taiwan's implementation of this new approach through three case studies. From this, the authors extract common trends and characteristics to articulate a consolidated framework for Proactive e-Governance based on citizen-centricity, data-driven personalization, and the empowerment of frontline civil servants. The article concludes with a discussion on the importance of shared global learning as leading e-governments simultaneously seek to uncover new models for governance in the 21st century.",

		"abstract": "Waste remains a serious environmental and human health hazard in developing nations, including those in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Despite important breakthroughs in waste management in LA&C, the region still faces many challenges that require special attention, such as the existence of uncontrolled open dumpsters (33%) or the low recovery rates of certain waste fractions (below 4%). Moreover, the adoption of sophisticated waste management technologies, such as incineration or anaerobic digestion, is still lagging. This review paper provides environmentally-sound and relevant policy support for municipal solid waste management stakeholders through a critical review of the current situation of the waste management sector in LA&C from an environmental perspective. Thereafter, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) bibliography linked to waste management, namely collection, sorting, recycling and landfilling applications and technologies worldwide, is used in order to understand potential alternative waste management strategies in LA&C, as well as the potential environmental benefits that could be attained. Finally, based on the holistic review and analysis, the adoption of more sophisticated technologies in landfill sites (e.g. landfill gas flaring), waste-to-energy, as well as higher recycling rates, would enhance waste management in the region and mitigate environmental impacts. A holistic view to support policy formulations, including climate action, for the adoption of integrated waste management strategies in LA&C is imperative.",

Since 1990, accessibility to ICT technologies, along with a drop in internet tariffs and prices of various devices like computers and mobile phones, has brought about a transformation of the activity travel behaviour of Indian employees. This paper analyses the choice of tele-work and its effects on the travel behaviour in Indian context through the disaggregated data collected from Bangalore, considering all potentially influencing variables on tele-work. The study covered employees who work from home either for a few days in a week or occasionally. The analysis was carried out in two stages. In the first stage, a preliminary exploration of the data was carried out to assess the presence of the tele-work scenario in the Indian context with respect to the worker's individual-and household-related characteristics. Secondly, the frequency of tele-work was modelled with the conventional variables of socio-demographic and transport- related characteristics. This research will be continued to quantify the benefits of tele-work in terms of vehicle miles travelled, savings in time and fuel consumption. The ultimate aim would be to convey to the policy-makers the strategic advantage of adopting tele-work as an alternative traffic management scheme for Indian cities.",

		"abstract": "Due to sun glare disturbances, drivers encounter fatal threats on roadways, particularly at signalized intersections. Many studies have attempted to develop applicable solutions, such as avoiding sun positions, applying road geometric re-directions, and wearing anti-glare glasses. None of these strategies have fully solved the problem. As one of the “Connected Vehicle” practices proposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation, advanced warning messages (AWMs) are capable of providing wireless information about traffic controls. AWM acts as a supplement to conventional signs and signals, which can be blocked by obstacles or natural disturbances, such as sun glare. The drivers' smart advisory system (DSAS) can provide drivers with AWM. Using a driving simulator this research explores the effects of DSAS messages on driving behaviors under sun glare disturbance. Statistical analyses were applied to assess (1) the negative impacts of sun glare, (2) the compensation of the DSAS AWM to sun glare effects, and (3) the improvement in driving performance due to DSAS AWM. Four performance indexes were measured, including (1) half kinetic energy speed, (2) mean approach speed, (3) brake response time, and (4) braking distance. The effects of the socio-demographic factors, such as gender, age, educational background, and driving experience were also studied. The analytical results illustrate that the DSAS can compensate for reduced visibility due to sun glare and improve driving performance to a normal visual situation, particularly for left turn and through movement.",

		"abstract": "Summary
This article aims to contribute to current discussions about “making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable” (SDG 11) by linking debates that are currently taking place in separate containers: debates on the “global land rush” and the “new urban agenda”. It highlights some important processes that are overlooked in these debates and advances a new, socially inclusive urbanization agenda that addresses emerging urban land grabs. The global land rush debate has ignored not only the fact that large-scale land investments take place in a context of rapid urbanization, but also that these investments are often triggered by urban demand, whereas discussions on the new urban agenda prepared for the latest United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) are typically city-biased, and pay little attention to the role of increasing cross-border investment in land and the transformation of the countryside. Using cases from areas where the global land rush and urbanization are simultaneously intensifying in the global South, we identify four areas that should be prioritized in current debates, namely the impacts of land investments on intra-city dynamics, peri-urban dynamics, and the emergence of new cities and new infrastructure corridors.",

		"abstract": "The field of city logistics can be characterized by its many local demonstrations and trials, that are quite often not lasting longer than the trial period. The number of demonstrations that continued and were implemented in daily practice is limited. Freight partnerships proved to be a good first step to engage stakeholders. This contribution proposes a new way to develop a more action-driven form of these partnerships that follows from a solution approach, which has proved successful worldwide in fostering innovation deployment, but has not yet been applied explicitly in the domain of City Logistics: Living Labs. The living lab approach ensures that the stakeholders are involved much earlier in the in planning and implementation processes, and that the proposed city logistics implementation is revised and continuously improved to meet stakeholder needs and obtain maximum impact for a long time. This contribution summarizes the steps that have to be taken to set-up and work in a city logistics living lab (CLLL). A CLLL can be defined as a dynamic test environment where complex city logistics innovations can be implemented, following a cyclical approach, where several solutions can be experimented and re-adjusted or improved to fit the real-life city challenges. In the Horizon 2020 project CITYLAB, we developed practical guidelines for establishing and running a city logistics living lab based on several living lab- and field test methodologies that enables stakeholders to set-up and run a CLLL. This contribution discusses the most important CLLL phases, roles, and characteristics, as well as the tools that are available. Next, this contribution shows the first results of cities in which CLLLs are actually set up, or already running.",

In response, this paper discusses a historical Deep Transition. It tracks the connected histories of Europe’s mobility, food supply, warfare, and ecological systems, all of which experienced a transnational infrastructure transition in the 19th and 20th centuries. Studying these connected histories as a ‘deep’ infrastructure transition highlights important dynamics of radical historical change. This paper also adds to Schot and Kanger’s research agenda, highlighting: (1) the importance of studying actors in Deep Transitions—particularly ‘system entanglers’ who interweave various sociotechnical systems and thereby connect transitions; (2) how such actors produced convergence, but also divergence across connected transitions; (3) the extreme unpredictability of Deep Transitions due to such divergences; and (4) the need for reflexivity regarding the analyst’s role in delineating Deep Transitions, so as to avoid essentialism and the uncritical reproduction of contemporary preoccupations.",

		"title": "Determinants of urban mobility in India: Lessons for promoting sustainable and inclusive urban transportation in developing countries",
		"abstract": "Studies from developed economies have analyzed the key factors for understanding urban mobility, which are important to design appropriate interventions to reduce the volume of transport needs and to promote more sustainable modes of transportation. However, there are limited studies in urban areas of developing economies, which can hinder our capacity to formulate sustainable transport policies that are fit for the reality of those countries. In order to fill this gap, this study quantifies the influence of city features and socio-economic and socio-cultural variables on mobility patterns to identify evidence-based policy interventions for promoting more inclusive and sustainable transportation paths. The research estimates the amount of public and private transport (proxied by out-of-pocket travel expenditure) and modal choices, employing multivariate analyses, using a nationally representative household survey from the 98 largest Indian cities. Findings reveal that densification in Indian cities reduces the amount of transport as well as enhances the probability of using public transport. Small and medium sized cities predominantly use private transport, whereas large cities prefer public transport but lack non-motorized transportation. Moreover, income is the most important determinant of the amount of transport and the use of motorized and private transport. The top quintile is the only with positive income elasticity of transport demand. Results show that public and non-motorized transport infrastructures will provide sustainable and inclusive development, besides other co-benefits, such as energy security. Based on these findings, several policy recommendations are proposed to improve the sustainability and inclusivity of urban mobility in Indian cities.",

		"abstract": "Ambitious eco-city initiatives of the 21st century are commonly branded as carbon-neutral, low-carbon, smart-eco, sustainable, ubiquitous-eco and zero-carbon emphasising their sustainability niches. This study focuses on one of these brands—ubiquitous-eco-city (u-eco-city). The principal premise of a u-eco-city is to provide a high quality of life and place to residents, workers and visitors with low-to-no negative impacts on the natural environment with support from the state-of-the-art technologies in their planning, development and management. The paper aims to put this premise into a test and address whether u-eco-city is a dazzling smart and sustainable urban form that constitutes an ideal 21st century city model or just a branding hoax. It, first, explores the recent developments and trends in ubiquitous technologies, infrastructures, services and management systems, and their utilisation and implications for the development of u-eco-cities. It, then, places Korean u-eco-city initiatives under the microscope, and critically discusses their prospects in forming a smart and sustainable urban form and becoming an ideal city model.",

		"abstract": "The paper presents a signalling exercise with a view to trace emerging dynamics in the development of the service economy in Europe. These dynamics have a direct influence and will trigger off service innovation. Firstly, the drivers of the service economy are presented, many of them fostering service innovation as a way to face new societal and business challenges. Secondly, emerging developments are discussed to identify the most promising service innovation dynamics. Finally, foresight scenarios demonstrate possible future trends of the new service economy. These scenarios are based on a methodology developed and applied in the context of an EC-funded project on Sectoral Innovation Systems. This exercise is performed for the overall set of services activities although a particular focus is given on activities such as knowledge intensive business services and distributive trade services. Results indicate that emerging developments are those related to the reconciliation between industrialisation and customisation associated with ICT, ageing population, sustainable development and service regression and extension dynamics. The cases of knowledge intensive services and distributive trades have shown how different drivers and emerging developments are interrelated and establish different scenarios for future development.",

		"abstract": "With the increasing demographic shift towards a larger population of elderly, it is essential for policy makers and planners to have an understanding of travel characteristics of elderly and their difference with younger counterparts. Existing studies emphasize elderly's travel mode, travel frequency, travel distance, travel purpose and affecting factors, however, very few aim at comparing the spatio-temporal characteristics difference between weekday and weekend. In this paper, based on GPS data and Smart Card data of buses in Qingdao, the two cohorts' basic spatio-temporal travel patterns in aspects of travel distance, travel frequency and travel start time in weekday and weekend are compared. In addition, directed weighted networks of elderly's trips and younger people's trips in weekday and weekend are constructed for analyzing spatial characteristics. Results show that although the number of elderly experiences a reduction on weekend their travel frequency and travel distance show growth on weekend. In contrast with younger people, larger geospatial expansion of elderly's travel on weekend is observed. Elderly are found to prefer traveling in areas with high elderly people's residential density. Our study provides a deeper and nuanced understanding of elderly's spatio-temporal travel characteristics difference between weekday and weekend, so as to support better traffic policy making and the promotion on age-friendly public transport service.",

		"abstract": "This paper problematizes the introduction of the concept of resilience into the planning domain from three main starting points: 1. The nature of the events which are said to require resilience; 2. The different nuances in meaning that resilience assumes according to those different events, and 3. The theoretical and operational problems the concept entails. The paper sustains that: 1. The quest for a resilient behavior or a resilient answer, and the claim to improve urban and territorial resilience do not find the same justification in every kind of event; 2. Multiple sub meanings are embedded within one interpretation of resilience that leave the concept open to rather large margins of ambiguity, which emerge considering its operationalization; 3. The concept seems to fit and to be appropriate within different paradigms, planning traditions and policy frameworks. Its alleged ‘neutrality’ is one of the main reasons of its pervasiveness, but also of its ambiguity, showing latent controversial implications, which are progressively emerging in critical planning theory.",

		"title": "The development of smart homes market in the UK",
		"abstract": "Smart homes will be a key component of smart grids as without them the functionalities and capabilities offered at network level will not be realised fully by householders. Yet an extensive body of literature focuses on energy consumption and management services via various demand side management programmes and informs us of a significant variation in the realisation of these benefits to reduce demand. However services which can be enabled via smart technology are much broader than simply energy consumption and management, spanning from assisted living to security to remote monitoring, control and management of appliances and devices. Using a combination of in-depth deliberative public workshops, expert interviews and a review of the existing literature, this paper gives an overview of services that smart homes can offer and reveals key barriers to smart home adoption such as interoperability, deregulated electricity supply industry, UK housing stock characteristics, tenure as well as reliability, security, and cost of smart technologies. The findings indicate a need for a holistic view for the design and delivery of smart home services so that consumers are offered integrated services across energy consumption and management to air quality management to security, allowing for individual or tailored services for householders.",

		"abstract": "Pervasive large-scale infrastructures (like GPS, WLAN networks or cell-phone networks) generate large datasets containing human behavior information. One of the applications that can benefit from this data is the study of urban environments. In this context, one of the main problems is the detection of dense areas, i.e., areas with a high density of individuals within a specific geographical region and time period. Nevertheless, the techniques used so far face an important limitation: the definition of dense area is not adaptive and as a result the areas identified are related to a threshold applied over the density of individuals, which usually implies that dense areas are mainly identified in downtowns. In this paper, we propose a novel technique, called AdaptiveDAD, to detect dense areas that adaptively define the concept of density using the infrastructure provided by a cell phone network. We evaluate and validate our approach with a real dataset containing the Call Detail Records (CDR) of fifteen million individuals.",

In this paper, we propose a mobile cloud-based physical activity advisory system utilizing biofeedback sensors and environmental context data based on calories expenditure from performing various activities by tracking user’s physical movements. To evaluate the proposed system, we conducted in total a three-month experiment on six users. For each user, we tracked the amount of burnt calories from the physical movements for a two-week period. During the first week, the system did not send any advice, while during the second week, the system was advising the user on activities to perform. The compared results of the two weeks collected data (without and with advice) reflect the positive effect of the proposed system on participants’ physical activity level. The system motivates them to reach or exceed the recommended number of calories to be burned daily.",

Stability & Reconstruction Operations are examined as mega projects, characterized by high levels of ambiguity and a non-permissive environment. The objective of this paper is to introduce a developmental view on managing a temporary network of contributors, and to examine in which dimensions development needs to take place. Drawing on mega project management and network theory, development of a temporary network of contributors is conceptualized using four phases: forming, storming, norming and performing. Data collection for our qualitative case study on Afghanistan focused on international actors involved in Afghanistan. We identified development challenges across four dimensions: heterogeneous stakeholders, governance, knowledge and coordination routines, and performance management. Researchers and practitioners may use this developmental view to better understand why mega projects fail or succeed, in particular when these concern heterogeneous network partners and (potentially) adversarial relationships among stakeholders in the project's local context.",

Noise in Alaçatı Village, which has been increasing since 2015, is analyzed here in terms of its constitutive processes, which include mechanisms of power and resistance. This approach shows how the normalizing technologies of the body, in conjunction with the inaction and contingency policies of biopower, result in the emergence of new power mechanisms with privatized and individualized modes of action. This study employed a qualitative method involving two months of participant observation and 45 qualitative interviews conducted in 2016 and 2017. The outcomes of policy inaction are as follows: (1) excessive noise is accepted and resistants become silent, (2) connections between noise supporters and resistants are lost, (3) responsibility for overcoming noise is individualized, and (4) de-territorialization and re-territorialization occur.",

		"title": "Review of GHG emissions in Pakistan compared to SAARC countries",
		"abstract": "Fossil fuel consumption, luxurious lifestyles, population and economic growths are drivers of climate change. Rampant rise in Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions drives the big wheel of climate change which affects human societies, animal habitats and woodlands by flash floods, glacial melts, acidic rains, droughts, famines, wildfires, epidemics, heat and cold waves. South Asia is one of the most severely affected regions on the planet due to its demographics. The per capita impact of climate change on the millions of Pakistanis is very high compared to their diminutive per capita share of global GHG emissions. Environmental issues of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries include deforestation, air pollution, desertification, glacial melts, sea level rise, water contamination and loss of biodiversity. Pakistan is among the top ten countries worst hit by climate change, where native populations of lions, leopards, dolphins, tortoise and vultures face extinction threat. Acacia and rosewood tree forests in Sindh, Punjab and Pak-Afghan precincts have already dried by dieback disease during 1998–2005. Hundreds of people succumb to death annually by heat waves in South during summer and cold waves in North during winter. Climate change is a global phenomenon; nevertheless, higher GHG emissions first affect local and regional territories and later impact worldwide. Pakistan's CO2 emissions are greater than least developed SAARC countries but much lower than the nearby Himalayan slope countries. This paper reports impact of CO2 emissions on society, forests, crops and wildlife in Pakistan recounting adaptation and mitigation strategies in SAARC countries. We present simulation results for a future super smart grid connecting Central Asian States (CAS) to SAARC countries for bilateral electricity trade, progress in carbon capture and storage technologies in SAARC countries, and original research on utilizing CO2 (R744) for water heating in extremely cold regions.",

Recognizing the vital role of information in international development, aid agencies have eagerly begun to adopt the tools of Open Government within the context of development (i.e. “Open Development”). Examining this trend, the author finds much scope for open data to support the development community's commitment to improving the effectiveness of aid by adopting a more systematic, coherent, and strategic approach to aid delivery (known as the “aid effectiveness” agenda). An investigation of the current state of the art finds that open data has made significant contributions towards realizing this more integrated vision of aid delivery, but that much of open data's potential remains unexplored. In particular, the use of open data is still largely focused on supporting after-the-fact reporting functions, overlooking its potential to enable integrated strategic planning and improved coordination across the full spectrum of development actors.",

		"abstract": "The Integrated Multimodal Travel Information (IMTI) plays an important role in the evolution process of holiday travel behaviour, which is seldom investigated. To fill this gap, this study analyses holiday travel behaviour dynamics with IMTI usage, based on the life-oriented approach. IMTI usage is taken as a separate life domain in this study, and a two-way relationship between holiday travel biography and IMTI usage biography over the life course, is examined after controlling for the effects of residential, household structure, employment/education, and car ownership biographies. Based on the web-based life history survey data, statistical characteristics of mobilities in each life biography are first analysed. Then, different random-effects ordered logistic models are established to investigate the biographical interdependencies from three aspects: intra-domain interdependency, inter-domain interdependency and outer-domain interdependency. The results show that the life biography is not only affected by a personal life course, but also affected by external background of the times. Under the interaction of inner individual factors and outer environment factors, there is an obvious dynamic two-way relationship between holiday travel biography and IMTI usage biography. Meanwhile, residential, household structure, employment/education and car ownership biographies have significant effects on these two life biographies. Especially, the influence of long-term state dependence for different life domains, over the life course, is much more obvious when explaining holiday travel behaviour dynamics and IMTI usage mobilities. Therefore, the life-oriented approach provides a valid method for analysing the dynamics of holiday travel behaviour with IMTI usage.",

These functions include representation and promotion of the home nation, establishing both bilateral and multilateral relations, consular services and social engagement. It encapsulates the adoption of multiple ICT tools over the Internet to support a nation's interests in other countries while ensuring that foreign relations are improved between the countries. Given its embryonic nature, little scholarly research has been undertaken to study its influence on diplomatic functions and the various factors that influence its implementation. This paper applies the Interpretative Structural Modelling (ISM) methodological approach to identify factors that impact the implementation of e-diplomacy and to determine their causal relationship and rankings. This study applies the ISM methodology to the subject of e-diplomacy. The ISM-based model provides a framework for practitioners to aid decision-making and manage the implementation of e-diplomacy.",
